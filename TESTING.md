Manual testing was carried out as soon as the project started using exploratory testing techniques and a list of bugs was identified and placed in a table to tackle.
At the same time as building each page, the site was tested using the developer console and printing those results to it, to make sure everything was working taking little steps.
Afterwards, formal test cases were developed and executed.
Automated testing was carried out at a later stage using validators and all errors were fixed, it was checked that all user goals are met and after this, a test case table was created.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### Python Linter

I used [Python Linter - Pep8CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to test for errors, most of the errors returned were related to formatting such as spacing or long lines of code, those were all fixed.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
